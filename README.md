# Car-price-prediction-with-machine-learning
Car Price Prediction is a regression-based machine learning problem where the goal is to estimate the price of a car based on various features such as brand goodwill, horsepower, mileage, engine capacity, fuel type, transmission type, and other technical specifications.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in real-world scenarios like automobile pricing, dealership analytics, and online car resale platforms.
